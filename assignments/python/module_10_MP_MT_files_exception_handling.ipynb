    "- __Condition Variables:__ `threading.Condition` allows threads to wait for a certain condition before proceeding. It’s useful for coordinating complex interactions between threads that require signaling, such as notifying waiting threads when a resource becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Semaphores:__ `threading.Semaphore` or BoundedSemaphore can be used to control access to a fixed number of shared resources, limiting the number of concurrent accesses to a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Queue Module:__ `queue.Queue` provides thread-safe, FIFO-based data structures. It allows multiple threads to safely produce and consume data without requiring explicit locks, which simplifies data sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Thread-Local Storage:__ `threading.local()` creates data that is local to the thread, so each thread has its own independent data without interference from other threads, reducing the need for synchronization.\n",

    "__For Multiprocessing (across multiple processes):__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Queues and Pipes:__ `multiprocessing.Queue` and `multiprocessing.Pipe` are designed for inter-process communication, enabling safe data sharing. Queue provides a FIFO structure, while Pipe creates a pair of connection objects for bi-directional data flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Shared Memory:__ `multiprocessing.Value` and `multiprocessing.Array` allow multiple processes to share data in memory. These provide synchronized, shared data types suitable for primitive data (e.g., integers, floats) and arrays. They require locks to prevent concurrent access issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Manager Objects:__ `multiprocessing.Manager` creates proxy objects for shared data types like dictionaries and lists. These proxies are automatically synchronized, allowing complex data structures to be shared across processes safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Synchronization Primitives:__ `multiprocessing.Lock`, `multiprocessing.Semaphore`, and other synchronization tools help manage access to shared resources in a multi-process environment, similar to threading synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Concurrent Futures:__ `concurrent.futures` provides ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor, which abstract threading and multiprocessing for parallel task execution. Futures (result placeholders) make data access simpler and safer, as each task’s data is isolated unless explicitly shared.\n"

    "- __Task Cancellation:__ In environments that support cancellable tasks (e.g., Python’s asyncio or Java’s CompletableFuture), propagate the exception to cancel dependent tasks, preventing further execution on erroneous paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Fallback and Retry Mechanisms:__ For tasks that can fail intermittently, retrying can help recover from temporary errors. Circuit breaker patterns are also helpful here to limit the retry attempts and prevent resource exhaustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Result Wrapping:__ Wrapping results in a container (such as a Future or Promise) allows capturing the exception within the container. Callers can then check the result status and handle errors at the completion point rather than immediately upon failure.\n",
